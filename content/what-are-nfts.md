## What are NFTs?

When something is non-fungible, it is has certain properties or characteristics that makes it unique, meaning it cannot be simply swapped or traded.

The recent craze in the marketplace has centered around the application of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a means of demonstrating provenance and ownership over digital assets, primarily artwork.

## Buying and Selling NFTs

When purchasing an NFT, the buyer receives both the digital asset as well as proof of ownership through a token, however in some cases, the original creator will also retain control of copyright.

A receipt of the token purchase is written to a blockchain network (most tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain network however NFTs are available on other networks).

Some content creators are also offering value add services such as a physical representation of the digital asset that is also provided to the buyer of the NFT.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of Distributed Leger Technology (DLT), it allows for the authenticity of ownership to remain unchallenged.

At the time of writing, the main marketplaces to buy NFTs include:

1. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
2. [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)
3. [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)

The reason why NFTs are making so many headlines is due to the extremely lucrative examples of seven-figure sums people are willing to pay for these assets.

For example, artist [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) sold NFT artwork for $63.9M - becoming the third most expensive piece sold from a living artist.

## NFTs and Smart Contracts

An interesting property of NFTs is that they can leverage smart contracts. For digital content creators, this introduces the opportunity to develop recurring revenue streams by implementing terms into a smart contract that sees them receive a share of the profits when an NFT is resold.

## Asset Ownership

Being digital, it is not difficult to simply copy or clone the asset, for example to right-click and save an image. Although you can obtain a copy of the asset itself, as these tokens are based on Distributed Ledger Technology, there is no way to also copy the ownership of these digital assets.

## Conclusion

It is yet to be seen if NFTs are a bubble waiting to burst or if this is truly revolutionary way for content creators to exchange value on the internet. Only time will tell.
