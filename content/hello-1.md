## Heading 2

We use IDEs when we need to work with a specific framework or platform. For example, Android Studio is helping us to create applications for the Android platform. On the other hand, code editors help programmers to work with various sorts of projects. Code editors have helpful features such as syntax highlighting, linting, and auto-complete.

Like most of the die-hard programmers, about 13 years ago, I initially used Microsoft Notepad as a code editor. After that, I just found Notepad++ and switched to it. I installed Dreamweaver. I tried to keep Dreamweaver as my code editor while I was working on many web development projects. The older versions of Dreamweaver had a pretty good performance on my Pentium-IV computer, but the later versions slowed down my computer. I got a chance to use JetBrains IDEs from 2015 onward because I was able to use my university email to obtain a Jetbrains license. Thenceforth, I was using Jetbrains IDEs all the time, without even using a separate code editor.
In 2017, like any other modern programmer, I installed Visual Studio Code. It looked great at that time, and I haven’t faced any performance troubles. Unfortunately, I had to switch to a low-end laptop during the COVID-19 situation. My current personal laptop has 4 gigabytes of physical memory. On the other hand, VSCode needs at least 8 gigabytes of physical memory if we use it with the web browser at the same time. I found that VSCode is lagging so often and making my computer completely stuck sometimes.

```javascript
const hello = console.log("World")

```
